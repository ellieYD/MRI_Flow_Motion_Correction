## Project: Phase-Distributed Multi-Frame Flow-Motion-Robust MRI
##### Description:
This folder contains code that embodies the methods necessary for reproducing results aimed at achieving phase-distributed multi-frame flow-motion-robust MRI (Final Year Project - MEng Biomedical Engineering).

##### Files:
- phantom_simulation_flow_motion: for simulating flow motion artefacts and the proposed sampling framework for flow motion correction
- Phase_Plotting: for plotting and visualising phase modulation across PE lines and frames
- data_compilation: for exporting data of motion-robustness for different sampling distribution parameters into .csv files
